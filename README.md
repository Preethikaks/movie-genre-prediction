# movie-genre-prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using text vectorization (TF-IDF) and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset
- **Files Used**: `train_data.txt`, `test_data.txt`, `test_data_solution.txt`
- The dataset contains movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres.

## Tech Stack / Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Google Colab (for training the model)

##  How to Run the Project
1. Upload the dataset files (`train_data.txt`, `test_data.txt`, `test_data_solution.txt`) to your Colab environment.
2. Install necessary Python packages if not already installed:
   ```bash
   run it on the google colab
